# Project Structure
Project consists of two different main folder BACKEND and FRONTEND.
In order to install dependencies, one should install each of them seperately via  `npm install` in the own directories and in the root directory there is another package.json for compiling frontend and backend projects at the same time. In order to compile complete project, just run  `npm run start`  command at the root directory".


# Run Project From Main or Development Branch
